CowboyUp

Horse swims with rider in saddle for a time.

cowboy up (verb) - to toughen up...
"When things get tough you get back up, dust yourself off and keep going."

Ever wanted to cross a water source without drowning the horse or yourself.
With CowboyUp you can ride your horse while it swims for a time {configurable}.
Once the time is up the horse starts sinking as normal.
If you ride off a cliff you have to get off the horse so it can surface but then you
can ride it to shore if the shore is close enough.
Also has function to help retrieve a leash {configurable} and to try and get the horse to stay when you dismount {configurable}.

Forge mod, client side only.

Control are bound like this by default [you can always go in to the controls menu and escape/blank/change them if you wish].
HorseSwimsWithRider * [multiply on keypad]
HorseStaysCommand / [divide on keypad]
ReturnLeash - [subtract on keypad]

When the mod starts the status of the separate functions are displayed after the first run and a
config is created. You can disable the status display if you want by editing the config after the first run.

Current Goals...

1. HorseSwimWithRider - Swim with the horse for a time/distance.
{configurable} swim with horse {default is true}
{configurable}...the time/distance is in blocks but is also tied to ticks [every 30 ticks counts as a block traveled as well].
{configurable}...swimming is slow [deeper than 1 block]
{configurable}...wading is a little faster [1 block deep]

Note: Wading does not count as swimming but you have to leave the water to reset the swim time.
Note: Or dismount [see below working on way to prevent this]

2. HorseStaysComman - The horse should stay when you get off.
{configurable} horse stays when dismounting {default is true}
The code is there but it just does not seem to take [apply] some times.
So I basically call the code a couple of times to get past lag it seems to work on single client.
The jury is still out on the server.
Note: If you log out and back into a single player world the horse will start to wander.
Still need to check on the server.

3. Leads should not pop off in some random direction when not breaking.
{configurable} for the lead to be added back to your inventory if it can.

Future Goals:...
-Add a hobble or stake that keeps the horse in one spot/area.
Set the hobble up on world load to look for the nearest horse within a set number of
blocks and tether the horse to the spot, or maybe require the horse to be named.
Who knows.

-Make a custom window for config so I only need one key bound in controls.

TODO:..
-Prevent dismounting in water from resetting the distance timer.
