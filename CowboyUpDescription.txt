CowboyUp

Forge mod, client side only.

Control are bound like this by default [you can always go in and escape/blank them if you wish].
	HorseSwimsWithRider * [on keypad]
	HorseStaysCommand / [on keypad]
	ReturnLeash - [on keypad]
	
When the mod starts the status of the separate functions are displayed after the first run and a
config is created you can disable this if you want by editing the config.

Current Goals...
1. Swim with the horse for a time/distance.
		{configurable} swim with horse {default is true}
		{configurable}...the time/distance is in blocks but is also tied to ticks [every 30 ticks counts as a block traveled as well].
		{configurable}...swimming is slow
		{configurable}...wading is a little faster

		Note: Wading does not count as swimming but you have to leave the water to reset the swim time.
	
2. The horse should stay when you get off.
		{configurable} horse stays when dismounting {default is true}
		The code is there but it just does not seem to take [apply] some times.
		So I basically call the code a couple of times to get past lag it seems to work
		but we are on a small server, time will tell.
	
		Note: If you log out and back into a single player world the horse will start to wander.
		Still need to check on the server.
	
3. Leads should not pop off in some random direction
		{configurable} for the lead to be added back to your inventory if it can.
	
Future Goals...
	Add a hobble or stake that keeps the horse in one spot.
	Set the hobble up on world load to look for the nearest horse within a set number of 
	blocks and tether the horse to the spot, or maybe require the horse to be named.
	Who knows.
	
	Make a custom window for config so I only need one key bound in controls.
